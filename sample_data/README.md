# Sample Data for LookML User Journey Analysis

## Important Note on Approach

1. **Load Sample Data Directly to Database**: Insert sample event data directly into your database's `main_production.all_events` table.

2. **Use Looker to Process**: Let Looker and your LookML model handle the transformations using the derived tables you've already defined.

3. **View in Looker**: Explore the data using the Looker interface, which will execute the SQL from your LookML model against the database.

## Sample Data Structure

The sample data in `all_events.csv` follows the structure required by your base table:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| user_id | Number | Unique identifier for the user |
| session_id | Number | Unique identifier for the session |
| event_id | String | Unique identifier for the event |
| event_table_name | String | Name of the event (e.g., page_view, search, product_view) |
| time | Timestamp | When the event occurred |
| event_date | Date | Date of the event |
| event_hour | Number | Hour of the event |

## Key User Journeys in Sample Data

The sample data contains several common user journeys:

1. **Complete Purchase Path**: 
   `page_view → search → product_view → add_to_cart → checkout → purchase`

2. **Abandoned Cart Path**: 
   `page_view → search → product_view → add_to_cart → exit`

3. **Browse Only Path**: 
   `page_view → search → product_view → exit`

4. **Quick Exit Path**: 
   `page_view → search → exit`

## Testing LookML Model

To properly test LookML model:

1. Connect Looker to database
2. Insert the sample data into the `main_production.all_events` table
3. Use the Looker interface to explore the data using model
4. Verify that the path analysis, funnel analysis, and visualizations work as expected

This approach aligns with how Looker and LookML are designed to work, letting the database handle the heavy lifting of data transformation.
